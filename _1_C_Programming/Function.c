  1.=> pre-defined function .
  2.=> User defined function.
  ->pre-defined functions are already declared into the header files.
  -> User defined functions are created by programmers.Å›
  and a function have three things.
  which is (i)=> functuin Declaration.
           (ii)=> function call.
           (iii)=> function Definition .
   2.=> Used defined functions have four types of natures.
      i.  => Take nothing and Return nothing.
      ii. => Take nothing and Return Somthing.
      iii.=> Take somthing and Return nothing.
      iv. => Take Somthing and Return somthing.
